# PTX Synthesist

The name of this project is inspired by Peter Wattsâ€™ science-fictional novel Blindsight (2006):

> Synthesist deal in the behavior of systems at their surfaces, infer the
> machinery beneath from its reflections above ...  understand
> the system by understanding the boundaries that contain it.
> -- <cite>Peter Watts, Blindsight</cite>

So the job of a "Synthesist" is to observe the patterns of highly specialized information 
and to package that information into an accessible format. In the case of this project, 
the system being observed is your CUDA kernels.

This project is currently at the stage of prototyping. Feel free to share your ideas in the issues.
